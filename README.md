# Data Exploration

Some of the queries created and the results:

**1-** Looking at companies which had 100 percent of they company laid off

**2-** Top 10 companies with the biggest layoffs

LIMIT 10;
```

**3-** Looking at the total laid off rolling out by month

```sql
WITH Rolling_Total AS
(
SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`,1,7) AS `Year-Month`, SUM(CAST(total_laid_off AS SIGNED)) AS sum_total_laid_off
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY `Year-Month`
)
SELECT `Year-Month`, sum_total_laid_off
	, SUM(sum_total_laid_off) OVER(ORDER BY `Year-Month`) AS rolling_total_layoffs
FROM Rolling_Total;
```

Result:

## Some notes:

- It is possible to use Data Scraping to populate the null values on funds_raised column.
- It would be nice to know the total employees that each company had so we could analyse the percentage laid off.
